# 🎯 Deployment Scripts Summary

## What Was Created

Two powerful deployment scripts to deploy your Tipjar to any network with a single command!

---

## 📜 The Scripts

### 1. `deploy-local.sh` 🏠
**Purpose:** Deploy to localhost for development

**One Command:**
```bash
./deploy-local.sh
```

**Does 8 things automatically:**
1. Configures Solana to localhost
2. Checks validator is running
3. Builds the program
4. Deploys to localhost
5. Updates client config
6. Copies IDL
7. Initializes tipjar
8. Shows summary

**Time:** ~30 seconds ⚡

---

### 2. `deploy-devnet.sh` 🌐
**Purpose:** Deploy to Solana Devnet for sharing

**One Command:**
```bash
./deploy-devnet.sh
```

**Does 11 things automatically:**
1. Configures Solana to devnet
2. Checks wallet balance
3. **Requests airdrops automatically** (if needed)
4. Builds the program
5. Deploys to devnet
6. Verifies deployment
7. Updates client config
8. Copies IDL
9. Calculates tipjar PDA
10. Initializes tipjar
11. Shows Explorer links

**Time:** ~1-2 minutes
**Handles airdrops:** ✅ Yes!

## ⚡ Ultra-Quick Start

### Development
```bash
# Terminal 1
solana-test-validator --reset

# Terminal 2
./deploy-local.sh
cd client && npm run dev
```

### Share with Others
```bash
# One command!
./deploy-devnet.sh
cd client && npm run dev
```

---

## 🎯 Why These Scripts Are Awesome

### Before (Manual Process)
```bash
# 15+ commands to remember
solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com
solana balance
# Wait, not enough SOL...
solana airdrop 2
# Check balance again
solana balance
# Still not enough
solana airdrop 2
# Okay, now build
anchor build
# Deploy
anchor deploy
# Wait, what's my program ID?
anchor keys list
# Copy that...
# Now initialize
anchor test --skip-local-validator
# Now update client config...
# Edit file manually...
# Copy IDL...
cp target/idl/tipjar.json client/lib/
# What's my tipjar address?
# Calculate PDA...
# Finally done!
```

### After (With Scripts) ✨
```bash
./deploy-devnet.sh
# Done! ☕
```

## 🎓 Script Intelligence

### Smart Error Detection
```bash
if ! command -v solana &> /dev/null; then
    print_error "Solana CLI is not installed!"
    echo "Install it with: sh -c \"...\""
    exit 1
fi
```

### Automatic Airdrop Logic
```bash
if (( $(echo "$BALANCE < $REQUIRED_BALANCE" | bc -l) )); then
    print_warning "Insufficient balance"
    print_info "Requesting airdrop..."
    # Automatically requests multiple airdrops if needed
fi
```

### Balance Calculation
```bash
REQUIRED_BALANCE=2
AIRDROPS_NEEDED=$(echo "($REQUIRED_BALANCE - $BALANCE) / 2 + 1" | bc)
for i in $(seq 1 $AIRDROPS_NEEDED); do
    solana airdrop 2
    sleep 2  # Respect rate limits
done
```

## 💡 Use Cases

### For Development
```bash
# Quick iteration cycle
./deploy-local.sh  # 30 seconds
# Test feature
# Make changes
./deploy-local.sh  # 30 seconds
# Repeat
```

### For Presentations
```bash
# Before presentation
./deploy-devnet.sh

# During presentation
# Share the tipjar PDA from output
# Show Solana Explorer link
# Live demo with real devnet!
```

### For Collaboration
```bash
# Deploy to shared devnet
./deploy-devnet.sh

# Team members can interact with:
# - The deployed program
# - The tipjar PDA
# - The web client
```

### For Testing
```bash
# Test locally first
./deploy-local.sh

# Looks good? Deploy to devnet
./deploy-devnet.sh

# Get feedback, make changes
# Redeploy
./deploy-devnet.sh  # Updates existing
```
