## ‚ö° Quick Deploy

### Localhost (For Testing)
```bash
./deploy-local.sh
```

### Devnet (For Sharing)
```bash
./deploy-devnet.sh
```

That's it! The scripts handle everything automatically. üéâ

---

## üè† Deploy to Localhost

### Prerequisites
- Solana CLI installed
- Anchor CLI installed
- Local validator running

### Option 1: Use the Script (Recommended)

```bash
# Start validator in one terminal
solana-test-validator --reset

# Run deployment script in another terminal
./deploy-local.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

```bash
# 1. Configure network
solana config set --url http://127.0.0.1:8899

# 2. Build
anchor build

# 3. Deploy
anchor deploy

# 4. Initialize
anchor test --skip-local-validator

# 5. Update client config
# Edit client/lib/config.ts to use localhost

# 6. Start client
cd client
npm run dev
```

### What the Script Does

1. ‚úÖ Configures Solana to localhost
2. ‚úÖ Checks validator is running
3. ‚úÖ Builds the program
4. ‚úÖ Deploys to localhost
5. ‚úÖ Updates client configuration
6. ‚úÖ Copies IDL to client
7. ‚úÖ Initializes the tipjar
8. ‚úÖ Shows deployment summary

### After Deployment

```bash
# Start the client
cd client
npm run dev

# Visit http://localhost:3000
# Connect with Phantom (set to Localhost network)
```

## üåê Deploy to Devnet

### Prerequisites
- Solana CLI installed
- Anchor CLI installed
- At least 2 SOL on devnet (script handles airdrops)

### Option 1: Use the Script (Recommended)

```bash
./deploy-devnet.sh
```

The script will:
- Configure network to devnet
- Request airdrops if needed
- Build and deploy
- Initialize the tipjar
- Update client configuration
- Show your tipjar URL

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

```bash
# 1. Configure devnet
solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com

# 2. Get devnet SOL
solana airdrop 2
solana airdrop 2  # May need multiple airdrops

# 3. Build
anchor build

# 4. Get program ID
anchor keys list

# 5. Deploy
anchor deploy

# 6. Run tests (initializes tipjar)
anchor test --skip-local-validator --skip-deploy

# 7. Update client config to devnet
# Edit client/lib/config.ts

# 8. Start client
cd client
npm run dev
```

### What the Script Does

1. ‚úÖ Configures Solana to devnet
2. ‚úÖ Checks wallet balance
3. ‚úÖ Requests airdrops if needed
4. ‚úÖ Builds the program
5. ‚úÖ Gets program ID
6. ‚úÖ Deploys to devnet
7. ‚úÖ Verifies deployment
8. ‚úÖ Updates client configuration
9. ‚úÖ Copies IDL to client
10. ‚úÖ Calculates tipjar PDA
11. ‚úÖ Initializes the tipjar
12. ‚úÖ Shows deployment summary with Explorer links

### After Deployment

```bash
# Start the client
cd client
npm run dev

# Visit http://localhost:3000
# Connect with Phantom (set to Devnet network)

# Share your tipjar PDA address with others!
```

### View on Solana Explorer

The script provides links to view your program and tipjar on Solana Explorer:
```
https://explorer.solana.com/address/YOUR_PROGRAM_ID?cluster=devnet
https://explorer.solana.com/address/YOUR_TIPJAR_PDA?cluster=devnet
```

## üí∞ Deploy to Mainnet

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: This uses real SOL. Make sure you've tested thoroughly on devnet first!

### Prerequisites
- Solana CLI installed
- Anchor CLI installed
- **At least 2-3 SOL** on mainnet (for deployment + rent)
- Thoroughly tested on devnet

### Manual Deployment (No Script - Be Careful!)

```bash
# 1. BACKUP YOUR KEYPAIRS!
cp -r ~/.config/solana ~/solana-backup
cp target/deploy/tipjar-keypair.json ~/tipjar-keypair-backup.json

# 2. Configure mainnet
solana config set --url https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com

# 3. Check balance
solana balance
# Make sure you have at least 2 SOL!

# 4. Build
anchor build

# 5. Get program ID
PROGRAM_ID=$(anchor keys list | grep "tipjar:" | awk '{print $2}')
echo "Program ID: $PROGRAM_ID"
# SAVE THIS SOMEWHERE SAFE!

# 6. Deploy (costs ~0.1-0.2 SOL)
anchor deploy

# 7. Verify deployment
solana program show $PROGRAM_ID

# 8. Initialize tipjar
# Create a script or use Anchor tests

# 9. Update client to mainnet
# Edit client/lib/config.ts to mainnet

# 10. Deploy client to production (Vercel, etc.)
```

### Mainnet Checklist

Before deploying to mainnet:

- [ ] Thoroughly tested on devnet
- [ ] Security audit completed (if handling significant funds)
- [ ] Backup all keypairs safely
- [ ] Have sufficient SOL (2-3 SOL minimum)
- [ ] Understand costs: ~0.1-0.2 SOL for deployment + rent
- [ ] Plan for program upgrades (use `anchor upgrade` later)
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Prepare for user support
- [ ] Have a rollback plan

### Costs

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Deployment | ~0.1-0.2 SOL |
| Rent (tipjar account) | ~0.001 SOL (one-time) |
| Transactions | ~0.000005 SOL each |
| Total Initial | ~0.11-0.21 SOL |

### After Mainnet Deployment

```bash
# Deploy client to production
cd client

# Option 1: Vercel
npm i -g vercel
vercel

# Option 2: Other platforms
npm run build
# Deploy the .next folder

# Set environment variable
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_NETWORK=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Command not found: anchor"

```bash
# Install Anchor
cargo install --git https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor avm --locked --force
avm install latest
avm use latest
```

### "Command not found: solana"

```bash
# Install Solana CLI
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/stable/install)"
```

### "Local validator is not running"

```bash
# Start validator
solana-test-validator --reset

# Keep it running in a separate terminal
```

### "Insufficient funds"

**Localhost:**
```bash
# Local validator gives you free SOL
solana balance  # Should show lots of SOL
```

**Devnet:**
```bash
# Request airdrops
solana airdrop 2
solana airdrop 2

# If rate limited, wait a few minutes and try again
```

**Mainnet:**
```bash
# You need real SOL
# Buy from an exchange and transfer to your wallet
```

### "Program already deployed"

If you need to redeploy:

```bash
# Localhost - just restart validator
pkill solana-test-validator
solana-test-validator --reset
./deploy-local.sh

# Devnet/Mainnet - upgrade the program
anchor upgrade target/deploy/tipjar.so --program-id YOUR_PROGRAM_ID
```

### "Tipjar already initialized"

This is usually fine! It means the tipjar account already exists.

If you need to start fresh:

**Localhost:**
```bash
# Restart validator to reset everything
pkill solana-test-validator
solana-test-validator --reset
./deploy-local.sh
```

**Devnet/Mainnet:**
```bash
# You'll need to close the existing account or use a different seed
# This is more complex - contact if needed
```

### "Failed to airdrop" (Devnet)

Rate limits on devnet airdrops:

```bash
# Wait 30 seconds between requests
solana airdrop 1
sleep 30
solana airdrop 1
sleep 30
solana airdrop 1

# Or use the devnet faucet:
# https://faucet.solana.com/
```

### "Invalid IDL" or "Program not found"

```bash
# Rebuild and redeploy
anchor clean
anchor build
anchor deploy

# Make sure IDL is copied
cp target/idl/tipjar.json client/lib/tipjar.json

# Restart client
cd client
npm run dev
```

### "Wallet won't connect"

1. Install Phantom wallet extension
2. Make sure wallet network matches deployment:
   - Localhost ‚Üí Select "Localhost" in Phantom
   - Devnet ‚Üí Select "Devnet" in Phantom
   - Mainnet ‚Üí Select "Mainnet Beta" in Phantom
3. Refresh the page
4. Try connecting again

### Script Permissions Error

```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x deploy-local.sh deploy-devnet.sh

# Run with bash explicitly
bash deploy-devnet.sh
```

```
1. Develop on Localhost
   ‚Üì
2. Test thoroughly locally
   ‚Üì
3. Deploy to Devnet
   ‚Üì
4. Share with testers
   ‚Üì
5. Test for a week+
   ‚Üì
6. Deploy to Mainnet
   ‚Üì
7. Monitor and maintain
```

### Network Selection

## üîÑ Switching Networks

### Localhost ‚Üê ‚Üí Devnet

```bash
# Switch to devnet
./deploy-devnet.sh

# Switch back to localhost
./deploy-local.sh
```

### Check Current Network

```bash
solana config get
```

### Manual Network Switch

```bash
# To localhost
solana config set --url http://127.0.0.1:8899

# To devnet
solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com

# To mainnet
solana config set --url https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
```
