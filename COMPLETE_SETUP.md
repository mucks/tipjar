## 🚀 Three Ways to Run

### 1. Local Development

```bash
# Terminal 1: Validator
solana-test-validator --reset

# Terminal 2: Deploy
./deploy-local.sh

# Terminal 3: Client
cd client && npm run dev
```

Visit: http://localhost:3000

---

### 2. Devnet (For Sharing)

```bash
# One command!
./deploy-devnet.sh

# Start client
cd client && npm run dev
```

Visit: http://localhost:3000
Share your tipjar PDA with anyone!

---

### 3. Production Server (Docker) 🆕

```bash
# Push to GitHub
git push origin main

# Automatically deploys to your server! 🎉
```

Visit: http://your-server.com

---

## 🎯 Complete Deployment Flow

### Phase 1: Deploy Smart Contract

```bash
# Deploy to devnet (or mainnet)
./deploy-devnet.sh
```

This gives you:
- Program ID
- Tipjar PDA address
- Initialized contract on Solana

---

### Phase 2: Set Up Server

```bash
# Copy setup script to server
scp server-setup.sh user@your-server.com:/tmp/

# SSH and run
ssh user@your-server.com
bash /tmp/server-setup.sh YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME
```

This installs:
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Nginx (optional)
- SSL (optional)
- Deployment directory

---

### Phase 3: Configure GitHub

1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Secrets → Actions
2. Add secrets:
   - `SERVER_HOST`: Your server IP
   - `SERVER_USER`: SSH username
   - `SERVER_SSH_KEY`: SSH private key
   - `DEPLOY_PATH`: `/opt/tipjar`
   - `SOLANA_NETWORK`: RPC URL

---

### Phase 4: Deploy!

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy Tipjar"
git push origin main
```

GitHub Actions will:
1. ✅ Build Docker image
2. ✅ Push to Container Registry
3. ✅ Deploy to your server
4. ✅ Start the application
5. ✅ Run health checks

- **Docker local**: Free

### Production
- **Server**: $5-20/month (VPS)
- **Domain**: $10-15/year
- **SSL**: Free (Let's Encrypt)
- **Mainnet deploy**: ~2-3 SOL (~$200-300)
- **Transactions**: ~$0.000005 each

---

## 📈 Scaling

Current setup handles:
